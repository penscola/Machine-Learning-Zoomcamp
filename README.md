## Predicting House Prices in California
![Alt text](https://github.com/penscola/Machine-Learning-Zoomcamp/blob/master/image/0_q_645J1CxoHpQN2L.jpg)

### Project Description
Welcome to the California Housing Prices Analysis! In this project, we are going to use the 1990 California Census dataset to study and try to understand how the different attributes can make the house prices get higher or lower. How does the location impact? How about the size of the house? The age?
This dataset has a lot of information that can help us. The main goal is to build a Machine Learning Model in python that can learn from this data and make predictions of the price of a house in any district, given all the other metrics provided in the dataset.
The project will be divided in 2 main parts: First, we'll take a little bit of EDA to gather insights that will be helpful to the model.
After that, we'll jump through hoops to create a ML model capable of making the best possible prediction on the house prices.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the 1990 California Census dataset. It contains information about the houses in each district of California. The dataset has 10 attributes and 20640 instances. The attributes are:
- **longitude**: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west
- **latitude**: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north
- **housing_median_age**: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building
- **total_rooms**: Total number of rooms within a block
- **total_bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms within a block
- **population**: Total number of people residing within a block
- **households**: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
- **median_income**: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
- **median_house_value**: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)
- **ocean_proximity**: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea

### Project Structure
The project is divided in 2 main parts:
- **Part 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis**: In this part, we'll explore the dataset and try to understand the main insights that can be extracted from it. We'll also try to understand how the different attributes impact the house prices.
- **Part 2 - Machine Learning Model**: In this part, we'll create a Machine Learning Model capable of predicting the house prices based on the attributes of the dataset. We'll use different models and compare their performance to choose the best one.

### How to run the project
This project is a Jupyter Notebook file. To run it, you'll need to install Jupyter Notebook first. You can install it from [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
After installing Jupyter Notebook, you can run it by typing `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.
